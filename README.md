# warriors
This C++ projects creates a phalanx of warriors depending on the user's desire.
After creating a phalanx of warriors, the user can control the phalanx of warriors by making them change directions, facings, and location.
At the end of the movements, you will be able to see a number of .txt and .png files depending on how many movements you performed.
You can take these .png files and create a gif using any online source (I used: https://ezgif.com/maker).
